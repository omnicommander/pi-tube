# Omnicommander Digital Signage AWS Branch

This is an extension of the original project, with the goal of transferring our video hosting from Youtube to AWS

Most of the software is written in shell (bash), but is being translated into python for longevity

### NOTE

The mouse and most gui elements *WILL* be hidden by this software, so in order to edit anything in the device, you should either use the terminal emulator (launched with `ctrl-alt-t`) or ssh (`ssh pi@hostname`).

You should not need to run the install script more than once

## Installation
To start installation use

`$ cd OC-DigitalSignage`

and

`$ sudo ./install`
